# mvvm_example

The MVVM pattern separates the presentation logic into three components:

Model : Represents the data.
View : It is responsible for the user interface.
ViewModel : Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.
This pattern is common in desktop or mobile applications, especially with frameworks such as WPF or Xamarin.

This program implements the MVVM pattern to separate the business logic from the user interface.
